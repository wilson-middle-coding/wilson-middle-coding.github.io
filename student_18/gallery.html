          <p>My favorite song is a million dreams. First off, it is a type of song that can easily up your mood when you are
            feeling down. Also, it makes you believe in yourself and not give up. This song is one that you can listen to over
            and over again when you are feeling down. It'll completely change your mood, as never before. Therefore, this is my 
            favorite song.</p>

          <p>My favorite book that I have ever read is the Land Of Stories series. Mostly, the first book.
            It always has cliff-hangers at the end of each book, which will want to make you read more in order to find out
            what will happen next. Also, there is a lot of creativity in this book. So many amazing, astonishing, and cool things
            happen that it will blow your mind. To sum up, the Land Of Stories series are my favorite books.

          <img src="https://cnjballet.com/files/2019/05/ballerina_3502865_1280.png" width="50"/>
        <p>One of my favorite things to do when I am bored is to dance. When dancing, I can put everthing
        aside and completely forget about all the negative things. Instead, I clean my mind and concentrate 
        on what I'm doing and how I'm dancing. this helps me forget about all my problems and worries. 
        Also, dancing is just fun in general because you can dance whichever and however way you want.
        All in all, dancing is one of my favorite things to do.</p>

          to play the piano because of many different and good reasons. </p>
