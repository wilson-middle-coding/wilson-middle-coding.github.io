          <img src="Thegraveyardbook.jpg"/>
          <p>This book is one of my favorite all time books. It's about a man who kills an entire 
          an entire family but the baby escapes. For many many years that baby was raised by ghouls
          and soon he makes a friend. That friend takes him to his old house where he makes friends 
          with the person you lives there. Pretty soon, the kid finds out that the man living in
          his old house is really the murderer. By the end of the book, the boy defeats the murderer 
          with the help of his friends and family.</p>
