          <h3>The Graveyard Book</h3>
          <img src="the graveyard book.jpg"/>
          <p>This book is one of my favorite all time books. It's about a man who kills an entire 
          an entire family but the baby escapes. For many many years that baby was raised by ghouls
          and soon he makes a friend. That friend takes him to his old house where he makes friends 
          with the person you lives there. Pretty soon, the kid finds out that the man living in
          his old house is really the murderer. By the end of the book, the boy defeats the murderer 
          with the help of his friends and family.</p>

             <h3>One Direction</h3>
             <img src="One direction.jpg" width="200px"/>
             <p>One Direction are one of my most favorite singers/bands. They are a british boy band that 
              started on the X Factor. They have great songs, and thogh my brother teases me about liking 
              them, I'm still going to like them anyway. At this very moment, my favorite One Direction song
              is called "Right Now" but it does change very frequently.</p>

                  <img src="growing pains.jpg"/>
                  <p>Growing Pains is one of my favorite TV shows. It was created in the 80's but is still very
                   funny. My favorite character is Mike(Kirk Cameron). Every time he comes on, you just know it's 
                   going to be funny. 
                    Basically it's about a family who goes through all these situations but get through them together.</p>

                   <h3>Swimming</h3>
                   <img src="swimmingolympics.jpg"/>
                   <p>Swimming is one of the best sports you can do. It helps you keep active
                    and teaches you how to work as a team. It may not seem like you work 
                    together but there are some drills where you need a partner/s and you
                    work together with your partner to reach the wall. There are also times
                    we do relays and that heps prepare the team for the competition. You work as
                    a team to try and win the race. Some people that are on the team thinks that
                    it's a joke, but I think it could be a very good oppotunity in the future. By
                    that I mean I want to be in the Olympics and my goal is to beat Ledecky.</p>
