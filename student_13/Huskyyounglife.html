         <h2>The Life of a Young Husky</h2>
         <p>This page is for info on young huskys<p>
        </div>
        <p>
         Young Huskies are in my opinion their cutest stage of life!
         At birth, as all other dogs, they need to stay with their mother at least until they are 8 weeks old.

        <h1>Here are some 10 fun facts about huskies</h1>
        <ol>
         <li>Huskies are born to run</li>
         <ul>
          <li>The original Chukchi dogs had to have a high tolerance to cold and the ability to survive on very little food supply.
           When huskies where used as sled dogs, they had to be able to run really fast to get to where they needed to be. Siberian 
           huskies are believed to be the closest to the original dogs.</li>
         </ul>
         <li>They have a lot of features to keep them warm.</li>
         <ul>
          <li>Huskies have a thick double coat that keeps them warm. The undercoat is short and warm, while the overcoat is long and 
           water resistant.There almomd shaped eyes allow then to squint to keep out the snow. Huskies also wrap there tails around 
           their faces when they are sleeping because their breath warms the tail and keeps the nose and face protected from the cold.</li>
