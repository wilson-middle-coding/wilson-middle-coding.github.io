          <p> Billie is born and raised in Los Angeles. She lived in a family of musicians and actors which as we can tell did impact her. She is the doughter of actress and screenwriter Maggie Baird and actor Patrick O'Connell who are both musicians. She was home-schooled with her brother Finneas. At the age of eight, she joined the Los Angeles Childrens Choir. Her mother tought the two basic songwriting and Billie wrote her first song at 11 for Maggie's songwriting class. The song was inspired by the series The Walking Dead. Billie also went to some acting auditions which she didn't like.</p>
